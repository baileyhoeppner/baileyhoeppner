    <p>
      As a dedicated member of the Formula SAE Electric Vehicle Packaging Team, I have been actively contributing to the creation of an Electric Vehicle for the 2025 FSAE EV competition. My role involves utilizing Solidworks to design multiple iterations of the battery pack enclosure, with a focus on reducing size and optimizing cooling. I carefully considered the placement of high voltage and low voltage components to ensure a perfect fit inside the chassis and easy removal for technical inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, I engineered a user-friendly charge cart with a dead man brake system, specifically designed for safe accumulator transportation. During the detailed design review, I utilized McMaster Carr for bearings and fasteners, ensuring that the cart is ready for manufacturing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to my technical contributions, I actively participate in weekly team discussions, providing valuable input and collaborating closely with my colleagues. This hands-on experience has not only honed my engineering skills but also solidified my interest in innovative and practical solutions in the automotive industry.
