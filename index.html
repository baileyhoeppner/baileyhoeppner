    <p>RMS Aerospace, LLC — Advanced Air Mobility Intern</p>
    <p>June 2023 - Aug 2023</p>
    <p>At RMS Aerospace I focused on stress and fatigue analysis for advanced air mobility applications. I researched and implemented effective solutions for project issues, ensuring structural integrity, and documented them for future reference. Additionally, I explored material composites to enhance product quality and efficiency. I am under an NDA for this project, so what I may discuss here is limited.</p>

    <p>Formula SAE Electric Vehicle — Packaging Team</p>
    <p>Aug 2022 - Present</p>
    <p>As a dedicated member of the Formula SAE Electric Vehicle Packaging Team, I have been actively contributing to the creation of an Electric Vehicle for the 2025 FSAE EV competition. My role involves utilizing Solidworks to design multiple iterations of the battery pack enclosure, with a focus on reducing size and optimizing cooling. I carefully considered the placement of high voltage and low voltage components to ensure a perfect fit inside the chassis and easy removal for technical inspection.</p>

    <p>Fashion Design in High School:</p>
    <p>Throughout my four years in high school, I dedicated myself to mastering the art of fashion design through extracurricular sewing and design classes, making me an expert seamstress. Fueling my ambition, I confidently participated in the Fashion Design and Technology Competition hosted by the Technology Student Association, achieving recognition as a state semifinalist. As a testament to my talent and commitment, I designed and crafted six garments, showcasing them in a captivating fashion show that left an indelible mark on the audience. My fashion design portfolio, available at instagram.com/baileyfashiondesign/, reflects my artistic journey and showcases a collection of my innovative and stylish creations.</p>
